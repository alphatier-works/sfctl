## Installing `fsctl`

### Using a Package Manager (Preferred)

### Git

More to come.

## Authentication

Before you can use `sfctl`, you need to authenticate with Starfish.team by providing an access token, which can be created on the profile page of your account.

```
sfctl auth init
```

You wil be promted to enter your access token that you've generated on the profile page.

```
Starfish.team access token: YOUR_TOKEN
```

After entering your token, you will receive confirmation that the credentials were accepted. In case your token is not accepted, please make sure you copy and paste it correctly.

```
Your token is valid üëç
```

As a consequece a .sfctl directory will be created in your $HOME and all data is stored for further use. You can safely copy this folder to other machines to replicate the access. Just be aware this is giving the user controlling the directory access to your starfish account.

You can log out by either removing the config directory or by executing the following command:

```
sfctl auth bye
```

## Account Details

You can access your account details directly from the command line.
